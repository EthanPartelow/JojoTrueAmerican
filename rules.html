                            1. Starts with a shotgun. Fastest Shotgun takes the first turn. Turn order is clockwise from where they begin the game.

                            <br><br>3. The person who’s turn it is always moves one space. Everyone else must win the challenge determined by that person to move.

                            <br><br>2. Complete the Quote: Player in charge of the turn begins a quote/lyric. Whoever jumps in and finishes the quote first/correctly moves forward 2 spots.
                            <br><br>3. Common Denominator: Player in charge of turn yells two people, two places, or two things. Anyone who can figure out what these things have in common wins and moves 3 spaces
						    <br><br><br>Winning: Beers must be finished before the game can be completed. First player to complete the circle and finish their last beer runs to the center, takes a swig from the bottle, and screams, “True American.”

                            Begin the game with everyone pulling a Tarot card from the deck to determine their stand before the shotgun.

                            In the middle space of the 1st and 3rd zones you must complete a challenge.
                            <br><br>1. Hamaon - hold your breath and flip an upside down cup on the edge of a table. If it lands upright before you take another breath, you are free to move.
                            <br>2. Thoth - When you get to this space, write down a player name and a way to move forward (Count, Complete the Quote, Common Denominator). If that player chooses to use this way on their turn, your prediction comes true and you are free to move.
                            <br><br>If you fail a challenge, you can’t move that turn, and you have to retry that challenge next turn.
