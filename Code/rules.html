                            2. Complete the Quote: Player in charge of the turn begins a quote/lyric. Whoever jumps in and finishes the quote first/correctly moves forward 2 spots.
                            3. Common Denominator: Player in charge of turn yells two people, two places, or two things. Anyone who can figure out what these things have in common wins and moves 3 spaces

                            Begin the game with everyone pulling a Tarot card from the deck to determine their stand before the shotgun.

                            In the middle space of the 1st and 3rd zones you must complete a challenge.
                            1. Hamaon - hold your breath and flip an upside down cup on the edge of a table. If it lands upright before you take another breath, you are free to move.
                            2. Thoth - When you get to this space, write down a player name and a way to move forward (Count, Complete the Quote, Common Denominator). If that player chooses to use this way on their turn, your prediction comes true and you are free to move.
                            If you fail a challenge, you can’t move that turn, and you have to retry that challenge next turn.
